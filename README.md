# AR Solar Plant Game

## About the Project
AR Solar Plant Explorer is an Augmented Reality (AR) application developed using Unity.  
This project allows users to explore and learn about a solar power plant in an interactive AR environment.

Users can place the solar plant model in the real world using their mobile device and understand how solar energy is generated and converted into electricity.  
The project is mainly focused on learning, visualization, and real-world understanding of renewable energy systems.
