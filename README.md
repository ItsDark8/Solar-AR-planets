🌞 AR Solar Plant Explorer
About the Project

AR Solar Plant Explorer is an Augmented Reality (AR) application developed using Unity that allows users to explore and understand the working of a solar power plant in an immersive AR environment.
The project is designed for educational purposes, enabling users to visualize solar plant components in real scale, interact with them, and learn how solar energy is generated and converted into usable electricity.

Users can place the solar plant in their real-world environment using their mobile device and explore different parts of the system with informative AR interactions.
